# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic
## Motivation 
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, people all over the world show their support for everyone affected by breast cancer. I choose to Analyze the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set for my Data Scientist Nano-degree project using CRISP-DM process.
## CRISP-DM process
- Busnisse understanding <br /> 
I used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set to answer 3 quastions <br /> 
Question 1: How many patients are daignosied with Benign tumors or Malignant tumors? <br /> 
Question 2: which varibles have an influnce in the target varible "dignosis" <br /> 
Question 3 : predicts whether the cancer is benign or malignant using LinearRegression <br /> 
- Data Understanding 
The diagnosis coulmns <Targit varible> have two values M\B  <br /> 
-- What are B and M  <br /> 
Tumors can be Benign (noncancerous) or Malignant (cancerous). <br /> 
Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread. <br /> 
Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body <br />
